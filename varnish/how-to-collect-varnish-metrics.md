# How to collect Varnish metrics


*This post is part 2 of a 3-part series on Varnish monitoring. [Part 1](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/top-varnish-performance-metrics/) explores the key Varnish metrics available, and [Part 3](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/monitor-varnish-using-datadog/) details how Datadog can help you to monitor Varnish metrics.*

How to get the Varnish metrics you need


Varnish Cache ships with very useful and precise monitoring and logging tools. As explained in [the first post of this series](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/top-varnish-performance-metrics/), for monitoring purposes, the most useful of the available tools is `varnishstat` which gives you a detailed snapshot of Varnish’s current performance. It provides access to in-memory statistics such as cache hits and misses, resource consumption, threads created, and more.

### varnishstat


If you run `varnishstat` from the command line you will see a list of all available Varnish metrics, with values changing in real time. If you add the `-1` flag, varnishstat will exit after printing the list one time. Example output below:




    $ varnishstat      
      
         MAIN.uptime                  Child process uptime      
         MAIN.sess_conn               Sessions accepted      
         MAIN.sess_drop               Sessions dropped      
         MAIN.sess_fail               Session accept failures      
         MAIN.sess_pipe_overflow      Session pipe overflow      
         MAIN.client_req              Good client requests received      
         MAIN.cache_hit               Cache hits      
         MAIN.cache_hitpass           Cache hits for pass      
         MAIN.cache_miss              Cache misses      
         MAIN.backend_conn            Backend conn. success      
         MAIN.backend_unhealthy       Backend conn. not attempted      
         MAIN.backend_busy            Backend conn. too many      
         MAIN.backend_fail            Backend conn. failures      
         MAIN.backend_reuse           Backend conn. reuses      
         MAIN.backend_toolate         Backend conn. was closed      
         MAIN.backend_recycle         Backend conn. recycles      
         MAIN.backend_retry           Backend conn. retry      
         MAIN.pools                   Number of thread pools      
         MAIN.threads                 Total number of threads      
         MAIN.threads_limited         Threads hit max      
         MAIN.threads_created         Threads created      
         MAIN.threads_destroyed       Threads destroyed      
         MAIN.threads_failed          Thread creation failed      
         MAIN.thread_queue_len        Length of session queue



To list specific values, pass them with the `-f` flag, separated by commas (and followed by -1 if needed).

For instance, to display the number of threads currently being used, run: `varnishstat -f MAIN.threads`

Varnishstat is useful as a standalone tool if you need to spot-check the health of your cache. However, if Varnish is an important part of your software service, you will almost certainly want to graph its performance over time, correlate it with other metrics from across your infrastructure, and be alerted about any problems that may arise. To do this you will probably want to integrate the metrics that Varnishstat is reporting with a dedicated monitoring service.

### varnishlog


If you need to debug your system or tune configuration, `varnishlog` can be a useful tool, as it provides detailed information about each individual request.

Here is an edited example of `varnishlog` output generated by a single request—a full example would be several times longer:




    $ varnishlog      
      
         3727 RxRequest    c GET      
         3727 RxProtocol   c HTTP/1.1      
         3727 RxHeader     c Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;      
         3727 RxHeader     c Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch      
         3727 RxHeader     c Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8      
         3727 VCL_return   c hit      
         3727 ObjProtocol  c HTTP/1.1      
         3727 TxProtocol   c HTTP/1.1      
         3727 TxStatus     c 200      
         3727 Length       c 316      
      […]

### varnishlog’s children


You can display a subset of `varnishlog`’s information via three specialized tools built on top of varnishlog:



-   [`varnishtop`](https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/2.1/tutorial/statistics.html#varnishtop) exposes the log entries that occur most often. You can filter to show the most frequently requested documents, the most common clients or user agents, or other data.
-   [`varnishhist`](https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/2.1/tutorial/statistics.html#varnishhist) returns a histogram of latency for recent requests.
-   [`varnishsizes`](https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/2.1/tutorial/statistics.html#varnishsizes) returns a histogram of request size for recent requests.

Which metrics you monitor will depend on your use case, the tools available to you, and whether the insight provided by a given metric justifies the overhead of monitoring it.

At Datadog, we have built an integration with Varnish so that you can begin collecting and monitoring its metrics with a minimum of setup.
