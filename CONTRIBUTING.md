# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to Datadog's blog, [The Monitor](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog)! We use this repo to review content updates to our longform guides.

There are a few guidelines we'd like contributors to follow when they submit a new issue or pull request (PR).

### Issues

Issues can be used to report broken links, outdated content, or other content issues. As a general rule, issues should include:

- a brief description of the issue
- a proposed fix with supporting documentation
  
**Questions or ideas for a new blog post?** Please do not use issues for pitches or general questions about Datadog. You can [contact support](https://www.datadoghq.com/support/) for any questions about using a particular Datadog feature. 

To help us focus on our guides, we will close all issues that are content pitches or requests for general support and redirect users to our support page where applicable.  

### PRs

Submitting a PR is the best way to fast-track an update to one of our guides. In general, PRs should:

- address a single concern 
- include a summary of the issue and your motivation for submitting the PR 
- your proposed changes with supporting documentation
